# MCTS_Tic-Tac-Toe
This project gives you an idea of how the search space of algorithm is reduced using Deep Q Learning (basically RL). It gives you an idea of how we could implement methods like AlphaGo on games using approaches like Monte-Carlo Tree search. Try running this on your PC. I think it'll ramp up the fans cleaning all the dust off the fans ... LOL !!! but don't try it on PC use instances on cloud, believe me.

Now, Just think of the search space and comlexity of a random character in a game and the complexitites in it's path while moving.
